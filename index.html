            <P style="font-size: 30px;">
                Hey! My name is Daniel Spresian and this is my page!<br>
                I like coding in all different languages!<br>
                I enjoy coding in <strong>Python, Lua, C, C#</strong> and am now learning <strong>HTML, CSS, JS</strong>!<br>
                I am currently undertaking a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Griffith University in Australia and have just finished my first year!<br>
                Learning to code has given me the ability to do many incredible things that I enjoy to do even just as a hobby!<br>
                An example of which is using the Game Engine <strong>Unity</strong> to program and build Nintendo 3DS games for fun!<br>
                I also enjoy programming games with <strong>Roblox's Engine</strong>, as well as now with <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>!
            </P>
